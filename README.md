About Me

I’m Subhan Jalbani, an SEO Content Writer focused on On Page SEO, Semantic SEO, Answer Engine Optimization, and Generative Engine Optimization.

I help content get found by search engines and understood by AI systems. My goal is simple. Write clear content that matches search intent and works for humans and machines.

I have a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology from QUEST Nawabshah. I’ve spent over two years working in SEO and content writing. During this time, I learned how Google ranks pages, how users search, and how AI reads content.

I now focus on optimizing content for modern search. This includes featured snippets, AI overviews, voice search, and generative tools like ChatGPT.
