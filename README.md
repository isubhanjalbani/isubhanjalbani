🧠 About Me

Hi! I’m Subhan Jalbani, a professional SEO Content Writer with a strong focus on On Page SEO, Semantic SEO, Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), and Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). I help websites rank better, get discovered by AI systems, and attract the right audience through clear, intent focused content.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology from QUEST, Nawabshah, where I developed strong analytical and technical thinking. Over the past 2 plus years, I’ve worked deeply in SEO, content strategy, and search intent optimization, helping brands grow organic traffic and visibility.

My work goes beyond traditional SEO. I actively optimize content for AI search, featured snippets, People Also Ask, voice search, and generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews. I believe modern SEO is about being useful, structured, and easy for both humans and machines to understand.

I enjoy experimenting with AI tools for content research, semantic analysis, and automation, while keeping content natural, readable, and conversion focused.
